    <p>Welcome to my site for setting up homebrew software on your Nintendo 3DS! We will go over the steps necesssary to create backups and modify
        the software so that you can install, or even create, custom programs.</p>
    <p>It is very important that you follow all the steps exactly as detailed, or you will end up bricking your device. While most bricks are able to be fixed
        with a hardware flash, this complicates things and is only recommended as a last resort. There are some bricks that are unrecoverable.</p>
    <p>This site will just go over general ideas and introduce you to getting your system modded. Please read full detailed guides elsewhere.</p>
